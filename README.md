# Rigorous Computation of Nash equilibria
This repository contains the code for my bachelors thesis. In this research, I explore rigorous equilibrium solutions in low-dimensional games in which the strategies are defined by real numbers and rewards are smooth. Rigorous computation methods such as the Interval Newton Method and the Krawczyk method were used to calculate the equilibria in order to ensure the correctness of the results. 

The rigorous computation of Nash equilibria entail computing small sets of where Nash equilibrium points must exist somewhere in the set and other sets where there are certainly no Nash equilibria present. Moreover, the properties of different types of equilibria were studied to further verify the correctness.

## Running the code
To run the code, at least Python 3.11 must be installed and the Ariadne library. To install the library, please follow the installation instructions found here -> https://www.ariadne-cps.org/installation/.
